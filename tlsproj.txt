1. An attacker intercepting packets could check the 'type' field of all packets and 
when she sees a premaster or master secret being sent, she could modify the hash so that
either the client or server get an incorrect master secret.

2. In the function random_int() the random numbers are chosen by srand() and a seed from 
our computer's timestamp. An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack because they could
try to sync their computer's timestamp so that they get the same random numbers.

3. A downgrade attack could work on our TLS system because it could force the server to use
a less secure cipher suite (for example SHA128 instead of SHA256) that is possible to crack with 
enough computational power. A way to mitigate this attack would be to force the server to only 
accept one cipher suite for asymmetric encrpytion and one cipher suite for symmetric encryption.

4. If an attacker intercepts our hello message they could then force us to think they are the 
server we are connecting with.
